# Android OpenCV OpenGL Assessment

Real-time edge detection viewer using Android, OpenCV (C++), OpenGL ES, and TypeScript.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project demonstrates integration of:
- **Android SDK** (Java/Kotlin)
- **NDK** (Native Development Kit)
- **OpenCV (C++)** for image processing
- **OpenGL ES 2.0+** for rendering
- **JNI** for Java ↔ C++ communication
- **TypeScript** for web-based viewer
